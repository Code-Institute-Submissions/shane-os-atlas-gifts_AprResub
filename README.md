## Site Layout and Design:

### Wireframes
Initially, I wrote down all of the ideas that I had for this site. Once I had firmly decided on the project, I drew rough sketches of my vision for the site on pen and paper. Following the refining of my designs through more wireframe drafts, I created electronic versions of these wireframes using the Balsamiq Wireframes software. The final versions of the wireframes are stored in PDF format, for the following viewing mediums:

 * Mobile
 * Desktop
 * Tablet

### Icons
The majority of icons used throughout the project were obtained from the [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) collection. On the font awesome site an account was created to enable the creation of a new kit for the Atlas Gifts site. The icons utlised were specifically chosen to direct users to key parts of the site. By decorating navigation links and buttons with icons such as a shopping cart, bin, envelope or a profile, users are able to signup, login, select items and pay with less confusion. This will help to reduce the likelihood of a user dropping out of the key processes thst lead to purchases of gifts on the site.

### Images
The chosen images improved the asthetics of items available to purchase, providing much more details about the item than a description could. These came from a number of sites including unsplash and pexels. Please see the [references section](#references) at the bottom of this report for the referemces of individual photos.

### Colour Scheme

![Colour Scheme](https://github.com/shane-os/atlas-gifts/blob/main/wireframes/atlas_gifts_colour_palette.png)

For the Atlas Gifts project, I decided to use colours that convey a range of emotions to inspire confidence in the site user. For example: The indigo Dye shade of blue is used in the payment section of the website to invoke trust and security in the user. The colour palette seen above and the accompanying report available in the wireframes folder was created using the [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) website. The main colours utilised in this project were:

 * #000000 - Black - Headings & main body text
 * #083d77 - Indigo Dye - Payment processing area
 * #C41C1F - Venetian Red - Delivery/ Order Confirmation section
 * #0EDB07 - Lime Green - Discount offer
 * #FFFFFF - White - Background & footer text

### Favicon

To enhance the website's design further, I created a favicon using the generator provided by [Favicon.ico](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).

## Testing

To ensure that the site was operating as expected, a series of print and console.log statements were introduced into the Python code fields to view the values of variables at key stages in each process. This was particularly useful when if/ else statements were used as it allowed me to determine which path the process took at each step. When an error occurred, this enabled a reduction in time spent resolving issues. For the site administrator and end users, django messages were included, informing them when key actions were initiated by the user. (E.g. Adding an item to a shopping cart, deleting an item, etc.)

### Code Validators
 * The HTML code was passed through the W3C Validator. One error found was the incorrect use of a p element as a child of a button element.
 * The CSS code was passed through the Jigsaw Validator and the three errors found were that of missing semi-colons.
 * The JavaScript code was passed through the JSHint Validator and the minor syntax mistakes were corrected.
 * The Python code files adhere to the PEP8 styling guidelines.

### Admin

The site administrator has control over key areas of the site such as adding, deleteing or updating gifts, viewing purchase order and handling customer queries through the contact form. Non-core areas such as the home page content and blog are also under the remit of the administrator. To test the site, a superuser account was set up and and the following tests were conducted:

1. Home

As the home page is the first aspect of the site that a potential customer sees, it is vital that this content can be edited quickly, to give users key information. (E.g. Discounts, Delivery Delays, Sales, etc.) For the home page content the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality was checked.) This was checked by creating a series of test content pieces with a title (Test01, Test02, etc) and a sample text body piece (Test01, etc.). Each content piece was then edited and saved. Then the content piece was deleted. To ensure that the additions, edits and deletions were visible to the customer, I logged out of the site between performing each function. The site administrtator is able to access the edit and delete functions for each content piece through buttons only visable to them when logged in.

2. Blog

The blog was created to provide users with more information on the site, new products, upcoming events, discounts, etc. The key functions of the app are allowing users to read the blog posts and allowing administrator to create, delete and edit posts. To ensure that users can not access the urls to add, remove or edit a post, the login required decorator was imported from Django Authorisation Decorators. This was tested by going on to the site and attempting to access the add and edit pages, whilst not being logged in. To help prevent the accidental deletion of a blog post, a warning modal appears when an administrator clicks on the delete button for that post. Administrators are then required to confirm by clicking the delete button again in the modal.

3. Gifts Management
To test the CRUD functionality of the gifts management system, a number of new products were created, edited and deleted. These items were added successfully to the shopping cart and then were edited and deleted in the cart summary page to ensure that the Gifts app was successfully integrated with the Cart app. These new items were then purchased successfully through the purchases app.

### User

1. Shopping Cart
For customers to be able to make a purchase, they must be able to add items in their desired quantities to their cart, update the quantities if required and delete the items if they no longer wish to buy them. To check this, I used a different device to access the site and added a number of items to my cart. Each time a message appeared informing me that an item had been added to my cart. I then clicked on the cart icon to access my cart, and changed the quantity of each line item by using the plus and minus buttons and clicking on the update button. To test the removal function, the remove button was clicked on some line items to take them from the cart completely. A further message was received informing me that an item had been removed from the cart.

2. Payments
To ensure that the user does not accidentally make a duplicate purchase by refreshing their page/ clicking on the Pay Now button twice/ etc. the button and the card used in the stripe form are disabled. In addition, once the pay now button is clicked a blue overlay appears with a message informing the user that their payment is now being submitted and to not refresh the page. The form was tested by making multiple incorrect forms entries (e.g. card number only having 12 digits instead of 16, expiry date set in the past, etc.) and attempting to proceed with the payment even after the form had already been submitted by clicking on the Pay Now button again/ enter button.

### Other Areas
1. Discount
To encourage potential customers to buy more from the site, a 10% discount was offered on the total value (excluding delivery) of the items selected once the toal was over a certain value (€100). To test this, a series of purchases were made with some having a total value below €100 and the remainder with a value above €100. The expected inclusion/ exclusion of a 10% discount was verified in the shopping cart summary page and also in the Stripe Payments dashbaord.

## Resolution of Bugs

### View Cart Items:
To make a purchase users must be able to view the gift selection on offer, select various items at various quantities and have them recorded in their personal cart. Users must then be able to view a summary of the items in their cart and edit or remove the items as required.

An issue arose when I tried to access the cart summary page after adding items to the cart. When the page is accessed either through clicking on the cart icon or typing the url in the browser. To determine the source of the error I examined the python files and cart html file for the cart app. After checking the model and view files and using the print function to help determine the error, I sought to make sure that the variable names were constant throughout the files. A small naming error was located between the files for the Gift Model. 

A second issue arose after the naming error had been solved. Unlike the previous error, this problem was resolved relatively quickly qith the help of the Tutor Support. Due to cached data from before the naming issue was resolved, attempts to access the cart summary were redirect to an error page. Once the cached data was deleted the summary page operated as expected once again.

## Deployment

To run the project locally please follow these steps:

1.  Go to the Atlas Gifts [repository](https://github.com/shane-os/atlas-gifts) on Github.
2.  Click the "Code" button and select the https option.
3.  Copy the link shown.
4.  In the Gitpod IDE (Integrated Development Environment) use the change working directory command ($ cd filepath)
5.  In the Git Terminal enter the git clone command ($ git clone filepath) where filepath is the link copied during step 3.

6. The project requires the installation of a number of python modules. For an individual module type the following into the terminal:

```
pip3 install module name
```

To install all of the modules required to run this project locally:

```
pip3 install -r requiremnts.txt
```

7. You will need to create a number of environment variables. Please create a new python file called env:

```
Environmental Variable Names and Keys
```

For the secret keys, a random key generator such as [randomkeygen](https://randomkeygen.com).

8. To migrate the models that are contained within the project code please enter the following in your development terminal:

```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

The above commands have created a local database.

9. To access the administrative panel that the Django framework creates, a superuser account will need to be created:

```
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

Once prompted you will need to enter a username, email address and a password. Create a strong password using a random password generator such as (Dashlane's password generator)[https://www.dashlane.com/features/password-generator]

10. To access the administrative panel run the server by entering the following into the terminal:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Open the site using the "open browser" icon in the Gitpod Workspace. In the browser add "/admin" to the site address to get to the administration panel login. You will need to type in your username and password.
